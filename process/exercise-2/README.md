## Exercise 2

### Audience Questions

- Who is your audience (persona, demographic or professional group, knowledgeable about context)?

  - Policy makers looking for overview and suggestions on water conservation efforts and funding opportunities
  - General public concerned with water inefficiency and safety

- How is your audience reading or encounter your project (media, UI, distribution channel, types of devices, spatial context)?
  - Digital devices: primarily desktop first, mobile and tablet supported with responsive design and touch gestures
- What does your project ask of your audience to do (input, involvement, user experience)?
  - Some basic reading to understand the problem (demand for water is increasing and supply is also decreasing)
  - (Potentially) Interact with a few case studies in the US.
    - After a featured case study is presented in part two, the reader can select from a few others before moving on to part three.
  - Policy investment simulator visualization asks users to adjust inputs and outlook to see model output for water conservation and water stress levels across the country â€” how far back can you push day zero?
    - i.e., climate change outlook, water pricing increase, animal product consumption, infrastructure repairs, technological advances, etc.
- What does your audience learn and take away from their user experience?

  - The audience will learn what we need to do as a society to get more usage out of less water:

    1. Rebuild failing infrastructure
    1. Invest in water technology
    1. Price water accurately and reasonably
    1. Change habits
    1. Practices to slow climate change

  - Readers will also understand the orders of magnitude between investments in these changes listed above. For example, a \$1 Billion investment in infrastructure may yield a more impactful output than investment in technology, etc. The last part of the visualization quantifies these decision points.

  - Finally, readers will understand that these measures will change our relationship with water and prepare us for a global water "transition" that shifts the geopolitical landscape in the 21st century.
