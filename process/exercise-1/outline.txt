Topic: Water Crisis -> Conservation strategy in the US
Question: I’m visualizing the effects of the water crisis in the US because I want to show the most efficient way to conserve and manage water in order to change our relationship with water usage.

Outline:
Problem
    - Demand for water is increasing
        - Growing population
        - Lifestyle choices and consumer behavior trends
            - Eating more beef
            - Buying more water-intensive products
                - Jeans / Denim
                - Soda / beer / coffee
    - Supply of water is decreasing
        - Climate change is making dry areas more dry
            - Colorado River drying up
        - Aquifers & Groundwater reserves are depleting
    - Water's geographical "transition"
        - Water is the oil of the 21st century
        - Mismatch of supply and demand will reshape the world
        - Peter H. Gleick, water expert theory: (https://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8863.full)
Solution for Conservation: how to get more use out of less water
    1. Pricing water correctly
        - Tiered pricing system
            - Los Angeles model
        - Rethink water pricing based on water supply of area is it serving
            - Applied to personal, industry, and agriculture
        - Privatization debate
            - Public utility stocks and investable securities
        - Water remains locally managed but pricing model is national
            - Updated government regulations
    2. Repairing infrastructure
        - The US if suffering from massive infrastructure failure
            - Leakage from broken pipes loses 18% of all treated water (6 billion gallons lost!)
            - Pipes were only meant to last 20-50 years but many are 100+ years old
            - The longer we wait the more expensive it will be
            - Water safety and contamination issues
                - Flint, MI
    3. Water technology and strategy
        - Technology
            - Sanitizing dirty and gray water and reusing instead of dumping into ocean as garbage
            "from toilet to tap" technologies
            - Desalination
                - Conflicting opinions / necessary evil
                - Australia and Africa currently in use due to extreme water stress
                - Negatively effects environment
                - Opportunity for renewable energy
                - Expensive and inefficient
            - LA: plastic balls to prevent evaporation
            - Farming
                - Smarter Irrigation
                - GMOs and "natural selection" to grow less thirsty crops
                - Precipitation management
                - Animal feedlot ops
        - Strategy
            - See Ogallala aquifer
                - Growing different less water intensive crops will reshape our countries food production dramatically
            - Understanding "Water footprint" as consumers to make better choices
            - Less animal protein
Audience
    - General Audience
        - Personal water for drinking and sanitation effects everyone
    - Policy Makers for infrastructure
    - Tech companies and business looking to invest in water technologies
    - Policy makers and economists looking for sustainable economic water pricing models
    - Policy makes for water safety regulations
