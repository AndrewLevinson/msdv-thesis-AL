Water Conservation in the US
Problem
    - Demand for water is increasing
        - Growing population
        - Lifestyle choices and consumer behavior trends
            - Eating more beef
            - Buying more water-intensive products
                - Jeans / Denim
                - Soda / beer / coffee
    - Supply of water is decreasing
        - Climate change is making dry areas more dry
            - Colorado River drying up
        - Aquifers & Groundwater reserves are depleting
    - Water "transitions"
        - Water is the oil of the 21st century
        - Mismatch of supply and demand will reshape the world

Solution for Conservation: how to get more use out of less water
    1. Pricing water correctly
    Tiered pricing system
    Los Angeles model
    Rethink water pricing based on water supply of area is it serving
    Applied to personal, industry, and agriculture
    Privatization debate
    Water remains locally managed but pricing model is national
    Updated government regulations
    2. Repairing infrastructure
    The US if suffering from massive infrastructure failure
    Leakage from broken pipes loses 18% of all water
    Pipes were only meant to last 20-50 years but many are 100+ years old
    The longer we wait the more expensive it will be
    Water safety and contamination issues
    Flint, MI
    3. Water technology and strategy
    Technology
    Sanitizing dirty and gray water and reusing instead of dumping into ocean as garbage
    "from toilet to tap" technologies
    Desalination
    Conflicting opinions / necessary evil
    Australia and Africa currently in use due to extreme water stress
    Negatively effects environment
    Opportunity for renewable energy
    Expensive and inefficient
    LA: plastic balls to prevent evaporation
    Farming
    Smarter Irrigation
    GMOs and "natural selection" to grow less thirsty crops
    Precipitation management
    Animal feedlot ops
    Strategy
    See Ogallala aquifer
    Growing different less water intensive crops will reshape our countries food production dramatically
    Understanding "Water footprint" as consumers to make better choices
    Less animal protein
Audience
    General Audience
    Personal water for drinking and sanitation effects everyone
    Policy Makers for infrastructure
    Tech companies and business looking to invest in water technologies
    Policy makers and economists looking for sustainable economic water pricing models
    Policy makes for water safety regulations
