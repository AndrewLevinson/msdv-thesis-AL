### I’m visualizing the effects of the water crisis in the US because I want to show the most efficient way to conserve and manage water in order to change our relationship with water usage.

## Water Crisis -> Delaying Day Zero in the United States: how to narrow the gap between water demand and supply

---

### Abstract

In 2012, the global demand for freshwater exceeded global supply. In 2017, Cape Town, South Africa made headlines as it approached "Day Zero"—the day the water taps shut off. While a day zero scenario for the United States is still far away, significant water stress is currently occurring throughout the country far quicker than previously anticipated. Instead of viewing these case studies as isolated events, Americans need to view these as warning signs that result in immediate action.

This project aims to visualize the global growing water stress gap, highlight individual case studies in the United States, and provide a strategy for key investment areas that make the most immediate impact. Culminating in an investment simulation, this project emphasizes the concept that water stress relief and water conservation is not an all or nothing approach. Investments in crumbling infrastructure, agricultural technologies to avoid over-abstraction of groundwater, and local water management all play critical roles in delaying extreme water stress scenarios.

In the future, our relationship with water will be challenged. Modern diets, population growth in water-scarce cities, and water intense industries all need to be carefully transitioned. However, in order to get there, critically significant but immediate investments in drinking water must be made before the problems escalate to unmanageable levels.

### Introduction

### Background

  - Infrastructure: Flint, Michigan (need others)
- Solutions
  - Direct Investments (infrastructure, ag tech, subsidies)
  - Orders of magnitude
  - Long term strategies (climate change, dietary changes, consumer habbits)
