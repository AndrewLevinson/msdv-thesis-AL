### I’m visualizing the effects of the water crisis in the US because I want to show the most efficient way to conserve and manage water in order to change our relationship with water usage.

## Water Crisis -> Delaying Day Zero in the United States: how to narrow the gap between water demand and supply

---

### Abstract

In 2012, the global demand for freshwater exceeded global supply. In 2017, Cape Town, South Africa made headlines as it approached "Day Zero"—the day the water taps turn off. While a day zero scenario for the United States is still far away, areas of water stress are currently occuring throughout the country quicker than expected. Instead of viewing these case studies as isolated events, Americans need to view these as warning signs.

This project aims to visualize the global growing water stress gap, highlight individual cade studies in the United States, and provide a strategy for key investment areas that make the most impact. In the coming decades, tough decisions regarding livable cities, diets, and consumer behaviors will all be greatly influenced by water. Culminating in an investment simulation, this project emphasizes the concept that water stress relief and water conservation is not an all or nothing approach. Investments in infrastructure, agricultural technologies, and local water management all play critical roles in delaying extreme water stress scenarios that can be tackled before devloping long-term strategies that change Americans' overall relationship to water. Modern diets, population growth in water scarce cities, and water intense industries all need to be carefully thought out but in the meantime, there are managable but significant investments that can be made to make these transitions easier.
